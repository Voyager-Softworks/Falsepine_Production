  m_description: "Some pagan practitioner\r we captured claims the creature attacking
    our shipments can be \"Reborn\" if it dosn't find it's killer worthy. Whatever
    that means, Sheriff and Mayor both agree it's nonsense but it's got the folk
    scared. Rightfully superstitious bunch. Town's put together a reward for whoever
    can put the thing down and come back without any burns. True or not, fella who
    succeeds is damn worthy in my books.\n\nKill the Omen within 90 seconds of encountering
    it without taking damage."
