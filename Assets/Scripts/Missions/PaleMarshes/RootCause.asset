  m_description: 'No one in town can be sure that the nightmare growing in the Pale
    Bayou will stay dead once dealt with, so we need a sample. Learned types are
    eager to study the tree and assess the occult presence within, in order to ensure
    it won''t come back. Anyone crazy enough to get a sample from the tree itself
    will be walking away with heavy pockets.


    Finish off the Wailing Tree with
    a melee weapon.'
