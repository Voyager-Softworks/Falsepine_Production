    at range. Issue is, it''s not always enough. Sometimes there''s too many or some
    bigger fuckers start spittin the spirits of the dead at us! As a result, buckshot
    is being considered. But it''s effectivity needs to be confirmed. Any lost souls
    lookin for a quick buck?


    Kill (6) Corpse Puppets with a shotgun or sawn-off
    without reloading.'
