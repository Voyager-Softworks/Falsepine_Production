  m_description: 'This illness that''s taken over the folks in the Grizzly Peaks
    seems to elude science. Some folk reckon you gotta fight fire with fire. So I
    hate to say it, but we''re looking for someone to test the theory. Cut down some
    of the afflicted with a weapon made from bone, theres a decent payout for anyone
    mad enough to get that close.


    Kill (12) Afflicted with the Bone Knife (Non-legendaray).'
