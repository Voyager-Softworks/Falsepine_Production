  m_description: 'The Afflicted frequently perform pagan worship at dusk. This gives
    us time to pick off some of the stranglers while they''re doing whatever it is
    they do. Loud noises won''t do though, any gunfire will alert them, and our lads
    will get overrun. This is a timely matter as well, so we''re paying top dollar
    for hunters to clear out a bunch as quickly and quietly as possible.


    Kill
    (20) Afflicted in under 4 minutes using a Crossbow (Non-Legendary), without firing
    your sidearm.'
