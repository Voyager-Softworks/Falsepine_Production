  m_description: 'The monster up in the peaks is a clever fiend, it''s started recognizing
    long-arms as dangerous, and it''s taken to fleeing at the sight of any weapons
    with decent stopping power. Sheriff''s boys either scare it off or end up dead.
    We need someone willing to go up against it ill equipped. Bounties especially
    high for whoever wants to make themselves a Falsepine legend.


    Clear the
    expedition and Kill the Bone Stag without a primary weapon.'
