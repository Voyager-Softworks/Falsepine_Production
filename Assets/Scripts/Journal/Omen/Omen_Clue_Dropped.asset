  entryContent:
    text: 'Seem''s this poor sod was searching through the remains of Omen''s victims
      when he got crushed by an unfathomable weight, burn marks indicate they were
      electrocuted ontop of being crushed, poor, unlucky fool. Common sense tells
      me not to stand under the beast when it''s grounded.
