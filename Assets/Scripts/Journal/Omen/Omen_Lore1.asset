  entryContent:
    text: "\"I have no idea how this happened, to be honest, I told the lads we were
      leaving because of the heat and the nearby hive but honestly, I'm just at my
      wit's end with this. We've had 3 incoming shipments fail to arrive, and 2 exports
      go missing. I assumed the hives were responsible, maybe perhaps they're expanding
      their territory. But no, today, when I saw the stagecoach halfway up a fuckin
      tree, smashed straight through the branches, well I knew that would be it.
      We need to put up a bounty, I might need to consult someone. Whatever it was,
      it could have been really tall or maybe flew. I don't even want to consider
      the scorch marks. No rest for old Mackey. \r\n\n- Sheriff Mackey"
