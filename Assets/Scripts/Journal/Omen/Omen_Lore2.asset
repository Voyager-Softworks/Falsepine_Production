    text: "What goes Bump in the Night: A collection of pagan sightings\r\n\nNotes:\nStill
      got to shorten that title. Reports of attacks in the Arid Badlands have led
      to the common belief that a monster made the location its hunting grounds.
      Well, I\u2019d believe it, there\u2019s enough of those horrible giant invertebrates
      running about for it to snack on. I\u2019ll have to make this sighting a quick
      one.\r\n\nA cow, practically incinerated! The beast could possibly weaponize
      fire?\r\nThunder during a clear day, I could hardly believe it but without
      a cloud in the sky, I definitely heard it! Hard to say if it's a sign or even
      occult. \r\nAn enormous shadow! I almost lost a good pair of trousers. A huge
      shadow from above swept over me just now, I was looking for signs inside of
      this large crevice when it happened. I'm unsure if it\u2019s safe to leave,
      but I fear the Invertebrates might take cover here as well, so I\u2019ll make
      my exit!\u201D \r\n\n- Field notes of book author Dain Robston\r\n"
