  m_title: What Goes Bump in the Night by Dain Robston
  entryContent:
    text: "Author Notes:\r\nStill got to shorten that title. Reports of attacks in
      the Arid Badlands have led to the common belief that a monster made the location
      its hunting grounds. Well, I'd believe it, there's enough of those horrible
      giant invertebrates running about for it to snack on. I'll have to make this
      sighting a quick one.\r\n\r\nA cow, practically incinerated! The beast could
      possibly weaponize fire?\r\nThunder during a clear day, I could hardly believe
      it but without a cloud in the sky, I definitely heard it! Hard to say if it's
      a sign or even occult. \r\n\r\nAn enormous shadow! I almost lost a good pair
      of trousers. A huge shadow from above swept over me just now, I was looking
      for signs inside of this large crevice when it happened. I'm unsure if it's
      safe to leave, but I fear the Invertebrates might take cover here as well,
      so I'll make my exit!\" \r\n\r\n- Dain Robston\r\n"
