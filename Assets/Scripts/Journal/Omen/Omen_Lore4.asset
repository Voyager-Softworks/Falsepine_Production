  entryContent:
    text: "I saw it, I saw it and no one is going to believe me. I have to make it
      back to town, and warn everyone, they\u2019ll believe me when they find what\u2019s
      left. We were travelling by night, the hive likes to sleep around then. It
      started raining, it\u2019s weird for the time of year but we realized something
      was up when the rain stopped all at once for a moment. Had no idea what was
      going on, but It was too late for us, and we never had a chance to react. \n\nThe
      thing blocking the rain landed on top of us. I barely got a look at it but
      it was huge, pitch black against the night sky. I got out before it opened
      its mouth, others weren\u2019t as lucky. A stream of lightning, fuckin LIGHTNING
      hit the top of the carriage. Andy, Harris, and Mollie were gone in an instant.
      I don\u2019t know how it didn\u2019t see me, but I\u2019m leaving my diary
      here in case it gets me on the trip home. Never been much for religion, but
      I\u2019ll be prayin.\u201D  \r\n\n- Celia Kepler\r"
