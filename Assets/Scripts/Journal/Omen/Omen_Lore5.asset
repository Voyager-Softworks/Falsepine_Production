    text: "S.M - Alright how about this, you tell me about whatever\u2019s attacking
      our imports, and I\u2019ll turn a blind eye, let you run off into the woods,
      and scream to whatever old-world thing you feel like.\r\n\r\nJ.D - It does
      not matter if I tell you her name, she will still soar. It does not matter
      if I tell you where she makes home, she will still hunt, and it does not matter
      if I tell you what she fears. She will still prophesize the end.\r\n\r\nJ.D
      - Her wings carry the sky\u2019s ire, her claws rake the earth, and her maw
      delivers oblivion. You will all-\r\n\r\nS.M - Are you done? I need to know
      where it is.\r\n\r\nJ.D - I will not say, you are- \r\n\r\nS.M - Fair enough,
      Jean, drop him in a ditch somewhere. Sorry about the blood. \n\n- Transcript,
      Sheriff Mackey, Jailed Pagan.\r"
