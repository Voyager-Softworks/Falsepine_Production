  entryContent:
    text: 'Well damn ! This outlaw hideout managed to put up quite the fight before
      succumbing to Omen''s attacks. They managed to damage its wing leaving behind
      some feathers. A quick field analysis shows they are covered in a thick oily
      substance, perhaps it''s how it can conduct electricity. I believe this rules
      out occult influence, meaning "Poison Ammo" should aid me in this fight.
