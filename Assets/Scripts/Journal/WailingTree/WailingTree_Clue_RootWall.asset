  entryContent:
    text: 'Seem''s some people where desperate enough to scavenge the old village
      for valuables but their fate was already sealed. The Wailing Tree uprooted
      the small jetty and all their boats trapping them on this small island. The
      ability to affect the very ground I stand on means I''ll need to be extra vigilant
      about my placement during the showdown with this thing.
