    text: 'S.M - "I don''t care! I''m not offering any more gear or labourers for
      your

      expedition!"


      S.P - "Please see reason Sheriff, the fauna
      and flora of the Bayou are all

      wrong! I can''t be sure of the reason
      but the ecosystem''s balance is volatile

      at best. If we have something
      dangerous on our hands then we should

      learn what caused it in the first
      place."


      S.M - "IF we have something dangerous? Of the last equipment
      and 4 boys I

      sent out with you, half the equipment came back, and only
      3 of the lads did.

      I can''t get them to talk about what happened, and
      they''re a mess! They look

      fuckin shell-shocked! So I feel pretty comfortable
      claiming that whatever''s

      going on is dangerous. I''ll be putting up
      bounties for anyone with more

      brass than brains to deal with it, no
      more expeditions, we''re just killing it. End

      of discussion."
