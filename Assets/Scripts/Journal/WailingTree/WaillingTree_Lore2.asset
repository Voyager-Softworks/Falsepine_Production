    text: "S.M - \u201CI don\u2019t care! I\u2019m not offering any more gear or
      labourers for your\r\nexpedition!\u201D\r\n\nS.P - \u201CPlease see reason
      Sheriff, the fauna and flora of the Bayou are all\r\nwrong! I can\u2019t be
      sure of the reason but the ecosystem's balance is volatile\r\nat best. If we
      have something dangerous on our hands then we should\r\nlearn what caused it
      in the first place.\u201D\r\n\nS.M - \u201CIF we have something dangerous?
      Of the last equipment and 4 boys I\r sent out with you, half the equipment
      came back, and only 3 of the lads did.\r I can't get them to talk about what
      happened, and they\u2019re a mess! They look\r fuckin shell-shocked! So I feel
      pretty comfortable claiming that whatever's\r going on is dangerous. I\u2019ll
      be putting up bounties for anyone with more\r brass than brains to deal with
      it, no more expeditions, we\u2019re just killing it. End\r of discussion. \n\n-
      Transcript of Expedition Request\r\n"
