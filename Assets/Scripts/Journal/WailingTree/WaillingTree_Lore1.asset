    text: "\"What's there to say, Munroe, I fucked up. Took the goods through the
      Bayou thought that would be the last place Sheriff's lads would go lookin.
      Well, I was right, no onegonna find those fuckin horses. Heard something moving
      in the water and got spooked, it was probably just a catfish or some shit but
      that's what I get for taking a leak. They had the saddlebags still on em, so
      I'm shit outta luck. \r\n\r\nLeavin this note here in case you have the same
      dumbass idea I had and head out this way. I'm gonna try find the stupid animals
      and try get out the other side, oh hey, watch the water, the last thing you
      want is a log turning into a gator.\"\r\n\r\n- Benny Smiles"
