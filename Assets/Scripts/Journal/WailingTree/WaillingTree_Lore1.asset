    text: "What\u2019s there to say, Munroe, I fucked up. Took the goods through
      the\r\nBayou thought that would be the last place Sheriff's lads would go lookin.\r\nWell,
      I was right, no one gonna find those fuckin horses. Heard something\r\nmoving
      in the water and got spooked, it was probably just a catfish or some\r\nshit
      but that\u2019s what I get for taking a leak. They had the saddlebags still
      on\r\nem, so I\u2019m shit outta luck. Leavin this note here in case you have
      the same\r\ndumbass idea I had and head out this way. I\u2019m gonna try find
      the stupid\r\nanimals and try get out the other side, oh hey, watch the water,
      the last thing\r you want is a log turning into a gator.\n\n- Benny Smiles\r\n"
