  entryContent:
    text: "The West Confederates had dispatched a single company of 118 consisting\r\nof
      3 platoons of 30 Riflemen, 18 Cannoneers supporting 6 SaltIron Artillery\r\nCannons,
      7 field medics, and 3 officers.\r\n\r\nThe opposition's numbers were difficult
      to catalogue due to their\r\nentrenchment and the unorthodox nature of their
      battlefield presence.\r\nHowever, they were estimated to be around 40-70 Practitioners
      with native\r\n support of around 200.\r\n\r\nThe West Confederates claimed
      victory at 0432 on Wednesday. Casualties\r\nsustained were reported up to 84
      lost Souls for the West Confederates and\r\n247 for the opposition. Additionally,
      the land was condemned, being\r\ndeemed too damaged by Confederate weapons
      and too afflicted by pagan\r\nmanipulation. The majority of casualties were
      unretrievable given both the\r\nconditions of the marshlands, as well as the
      state of the deceased.\r\n\r\n- Battle of Grainwater War Correspondence\n"
