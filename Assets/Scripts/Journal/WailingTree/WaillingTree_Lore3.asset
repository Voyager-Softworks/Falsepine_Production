    text: "What goes Bump in the Night: A collection of pagan sightings.\r\nAuthors
      Note - Perhaps I need to shorten the title.\r\n\nWhispers were heard from the
      marsh at night. Definitely occult, suggesting\r\na spiritual influence. Solution:
      Earmuffs - Didn\u2019t work.\r\nMessages scratched into tree bark, either I\u2019m
      being messed with or this is a\r\ndefinite sign of a tangible entity. Or at
      least it can manifest somehow? If\r\nanything bad happens I\u2019ll need to
      run now that I know it could hurt me.\r\nSolution: Ring of Salt Too wet.\r\n\nMessages:
      * Get Down, * What do we do?, * Fire, * Fall Back, * Run.\r\nMoving roots!
      This is definitely the entity! Or at least something affected,\r\npossibly
      possessed? I\u2019m going to try to follow the roots and find the tree\r\nthey
      belong to.\r\n\nA huge infected tree! It appears sickly, twisted, and clearly
      hosts the moving roots. I wanted to get a sample but I noticed dead bodies
      in the water near its base, I have no interest in joining them! Now that I\u2019m
      a comfortable distance from the thing I can speculate that it must be feeding
      off of the dead. Given its occult nature it\u2019s hard to know what parts
      of the body it deems relevant. Whatever it is, it shall make for a fabulous
      nightmare to add to my book. \n\n- Field notes of book author Dain Robston\r\n"
