    text: "*Author's Edit - Perhaps I need to shorten the title of my book.\r\n\r\nAuthor
      Notes:\r\n\"Whispers were heard from the marsh at night. Definitely occult,
      suggesting a spiritual influence. Solution: Earmuffs - Didn't work.\r\n\r\nMessages
      scratched into tree bark, either I'm being messed with or this is a definite
      sign of a \rtangible entity. Or at least it can manifest somehow? If anything
      bad happens I'll need to run \rnow that I know it could hurt me. Solution:
      Ring of Salt Too wet.\r\n\r\nMoving roots! This is definitely the entity! Or
      at least something affected, possibly possessed? I'm going to try to follow
      the roots and find the tree they belong to.\r\n\r\nA huge infected tree! It
      appears sickly, twisted, and clearly hosts the moving roots. I wanted to get
      a sample but I noticed dead bodies in the water near its base, I have no interest
      in joining them! Now that I'm a comfortable distance from the thing I can speculate
      that it must be feeding off of the dead. Given its occult nature it's hard
      to know what parts of the body it deems relevant. Whatever it is, it shall
      make for a fabulous nightmare to add to my book.\"\r\n\r\n- Dain Robston\r\n\r"
