    text: '"Listen, all I''m saying is ye should never go too far in!

      Seriously,
      me brother came back last fall, and he wasn''t alright ye see?

      Ay shut
      it! I''m tellin'' a story here ye rot mouth. So, he comes back, sits on his

      bed
      fer like a week, shits himself, and doesn''t notice, absolutely vile.

      

      Anyways,
      so I get to asking him what happened out here, he''s a plank,

      and doesn''t
      say nothin for a few days. But while helpin me poor brother have

      something
      to eat he grabs me, right like this and he starts tellin'' me about how he
      saw a

      deadman try to grab him. Starts cryin, babblin, spoutin off about
      deadmen, whispers, screaming, trees, and all kinds of shit. Now look, I know
      we''re all gents of magnificent bollocks, but I''ll say right now, just on
      the chance me brothers not lost it and he''s talkin truth. We best sleep with
      an eye open and try not go in too far right? Who knows, some rotter might grab
      ya, another soul for the bog ay?"
