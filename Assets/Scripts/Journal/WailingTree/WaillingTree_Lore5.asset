      ye should never go too far in!\r\nSeriously, me brother came back last fall,
      and he wasn\u2019t alright ye see?\r\nAy shut it! I\u2019m tellin' a story
      here ye rot mouth. So, he comes back, sits on his\r bed fer like a week, shits
      himself, and doesn't notice, absolutely vile.\r\n\nAnyways, so I get to asking
      him what happened out here, he's a plank,\r\nand doesn't say nothin for a few
      days. But while helpin me poor brother have\r something to eat he grabs me,
      right like this and he starts tellin' me about how he saw a\r deadman try to
      grab him. Starts cryin, babblin, spoutin off about deadmen,\r whispers, screaming,
      trees, and all kinds of shit. Now look, I know we\u2019re all\r gents of magnificent
      bollocks, but I\u2019ll say right now, just on the chance me\r brothers not
      lost it and he's talkin truth. We best sleep with an eye open and\r try not
      go in too far right? Who knows, some rotter might grab ya, another\r soul for
      the bog ay?\r\"\n"
