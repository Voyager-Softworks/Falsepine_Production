      as his blasted dog, he doesn't believe me because apparently,\r\nstags don\u2019t
      move that fast and I'm apparently confused. Well, he can enjoy\r\nsteering
      the horses while I stay \u201Cconfused\u201D inside the safety of the carriage!\u201D\r\n\n\u201CThat
      thing, it\u2019s back, my Francis is gone. Whatever it is, it took him before\r\nthe
      animals even reared. Nothing can do that, nothing! It\u2019s a demon, or the\r\ndevil
      himself maybe. I\u2019ve been down here for an hour, I\u2019m praying it does
