    text: '"On the 3rd path we saw it, a Buck with crescent horns, thing looked like
      some sort of pagan spirit, maybe it was. James was drunk and tried to down
      the creature with his rifle.


      "James is getting worse, whatever it did
      to him has his blood weeping from his skin its fuckin'' wrong, did he catch
      an illness from it ?"


      "He''s gone, screaming and running off into the
      snow like a damned fool in nothing but his bedspread, I have no idea what to
      tell his dear Anna..."


      - Thomas.
