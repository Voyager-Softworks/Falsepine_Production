      Mason, Gorden R. McCalister, Joseph D. Cottman.\u201D\r\n\n\u201CThe lads and
      I found 3 of them, madder than rattlesnakes they were. They\r\nCame at us with
      anything they could find, hollering about something called\r\na Bone Stag,
      whatever the fuck that is.\u201D\r\n\n\u201CThese folk are gone, we had to
      put them below heel, whatever this Bone\r\nStag nonsense is it seems to be
      affecting their damn minds. The lads are\r\nspooked and there are a lot more
      than 5 of them. We\u2019re pulling the fuck\r\nout.\u201D \n\n- Field Log,
      Constable Howser.\r\n"
