      - Orsen B. Loughman, Fern J. Dunklin, Arletta
      J. Mason, Gorden R. McCalister, Joseph D.Cottman.


      "The lads and I found
      3 of em''. Madder than rattlesnakes they were. They came at us with anyting
      that could find, ranting and hollering about a Bone Stag, whatever the fuck
      that is."


      "These folk are unwell, we had to put em below heel, whatever
      this Bone Stag nonsense is it appears to affect their damn minds. The lads
      are spooked and there are more than just the three the missing persons roaming
      the hillside. We''re pulling the fuck out."
