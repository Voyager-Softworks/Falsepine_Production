    text: '- Sure did Sheriff, sounded like wheezing and ragged breathing I drew
      by iron to be safe, but pushed on to see if some fella was hurt.


      -

      pagans duty.


      - Damn right ! Anyway I got close, and saw what looked
      like a sack or cargo cover, mayby an old bedsheet ? Either way, I asked him
