    text: "- Sure did Sheriff, sounded like wheezing and ragged breathing so you
      know, I\r drew my irons but went to see if some fella was hurt.\r\n\n- Yes
      sir, the lawmen told me that was the case but leaving folk in need is a\r\npagans
      duty.\r\n\n- Damn right! Anyways I got close, looked like a sack or cargo sheet,
      maybe\r a really shitty blanket? Anyway, I asked if he was alright and after
      I saw its\r face I made smoke and put boot to dirt.\r\n\n- No Sheriff, it looked
      like it was trying to hide its face, almost looked\r\nashamed, it croaked somethin
      at me, sounded a bit like Anna? Yeah, the\r\nname. Honestly, I ain\u2019t going
      back out there, I swear I can still hear it in my\r\nhead, doc says there's
      nothing wrong with me, but still\u2026 I\u2026\r\n\n- Yeah, sure thing Sheriff\u2026\u201D
      \n\n- Field report transcript, Douglas Kerkwood.\r\n"
