  m_title: Dynamite Stash
  entryContent:
    text: 'Unfortunately, these crates of dynamite have been left in the harsh elements
      for too long rendering them useless. The small camp leads me to believe that
      these hunters thought they could take down the Bone Stag with enough dynamite.
      Judging by the used crates and the presence of the Bone Stag it seems they
      guessed wrong. The beast moves to fast and can easily dodge a blast.
