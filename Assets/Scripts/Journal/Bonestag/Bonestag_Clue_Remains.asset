    text: 'I found a morbid sight, a miner who looked to be in the early stages of
      an infection strung up one large stakes, presumably to warn of tresspassers.
      It seems purposefully constructed the pickaxe laid at the base leads me to
      belief this poor fool tried attacking the Bone Stag hoping to bring an end
      to their curse, unlucky for him this beast excells in close quaters combat.
      I should keep my distance.
