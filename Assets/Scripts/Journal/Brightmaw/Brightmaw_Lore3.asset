    text: '- Rusty Wildwood Zoological Sightings: Hare x16, Boar x2, Snake x3, Unknown
      x9, Deer x4, Avian x27.

      

      - Field Assessment: Fauna Flora appear
      healthy and in prosperous conditions. Hare populations are on a decline, perhaps
      due to Bottleneck Disease or over-predation, however, it''s worth monitoring.

      

      Notes:
      "I''ve found a strange new species deep in the woods, I''m sure I will benefit
      from its discovery. These beasts are hound sized, quadrupedal, with pale, albino
      skin. While this discovery is great news, they do appear highly aggressive
      and attack in numbers. Not to assume they communicate, they are more akin to
      a school of piranha, attacking in a frenzy.

      

      There is also
      minor, unrecorded seismic activity in the area. I may need to consult a seismologist.
      Of the samples gathered I only gathered a few leftover carcasses and droppings.
      The signs of predation match the newly discovered species... Could they be
      invasive ?"
