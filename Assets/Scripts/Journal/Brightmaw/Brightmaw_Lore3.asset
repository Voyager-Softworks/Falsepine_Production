    text: "- \u201CSightings : Hare x16, Boar x2, Snake x3, Unknown x9, Deer x4,
      Avian x27.\r\n\n- Field assessment : Fauna and flora appear healthy and in\r\nprosperous
      conditions. There is a slight underpopulation of hare,\r\nwhich could just
      be bottleneck disease or over-predation, however,\r\nit\u2019s worth monitoring.\r\n\n-
      Notes : I\u2019ve found a strange new species out here, I'm sure to benefit\r\nfrom
      the discovery. They\u2019re hound-sized, quadrupedal, and look\r\nalmost Albino.
      While the discovery is great news, they do appear\r\nhighly aggressive and
      attack in numbers. Not to say there is\r\ncommunication or teamwork, they act
      more akin to a school of\r\npiranha, attacking all at once.\r\n\nThere also
      appears to be minor previously unrecorded seismic\r\nactivity in the area.
      I may need to consult a seismologist.\r\nOf the samples gathered I was only
      able to gather a few leftover\r\ncarcasses and droppings. The signs of predation
      match the newly\r\ndiscovered species\u2026 Could it be invasive?\u201D\r\n\n-
