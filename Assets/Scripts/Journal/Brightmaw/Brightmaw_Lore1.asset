    text: "\"It's been about 4 days, I'm writing this for my mother and sister in
      case I don't make it out of this damned forest. I was chasing after a boar
      but I suppose I chased it too far into the woods, and almost ran head-first
      into a charging buck, can you believe that shit ? Good news is, if I get out,
      I'll have venison. The bad news is, he sent me down a bank ass over teakettle.
      So for now I'm stuck down here. Honestly, though this is just a precaution,
      I'm sure I'll be home in no time ma ! Though I have heard this rumbling down
      in the dirt and it has me spooked.\"\r\n\r\n\"Holy Shit ma ! I was resting
      under a log out of this damn rain when some giant fuckin' thing exploded out
      of the ground ! I lay still and shut my trap, if it comes back, I'll do ya
      proud Ma.\"\r\n\r\n- Presley Hartman\r\n\r"
