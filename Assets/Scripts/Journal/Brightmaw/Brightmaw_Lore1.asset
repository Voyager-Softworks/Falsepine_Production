    text: "\u201CIt\u2019s been about 4 days, I'm writing this out for my mother
      and\r\nsister in case I can\u2019t get out with this busted leg. I was following
      some hog,\r\nbut I suppose I went too far in, a buck almost ran me through,
      can you\r\nbelieve that shit? Good news is, if I get out, I\u2019ll have some
      venison. The bad\r\nnews is, he sent me down a bank ass over teakettle. So
      that might be tricky.\r Honestly, though, this is just a precaution, I'm sure
      I'll be fine! Though there\r is this rumbling in the dirt every now and again
      that has me on edge.\u201D\r\n\n\u201CI hid under a log in the early morning
      hours, some giant fuckin thing\r\nexploded out the ground! I lay still and
      shut my trap, if it comes back, I\u2019ll do\r\nya proud Ma.\u201D \n\n- Hunting
      Log, Presley Hartmen.\r\n"
