    text: '"Day 1: We''re on the beasts trail ! Honestly, I''d almost say the thing''s
      cocky, leaving carrion, burrows and uprooted saplings all over the woods, acting
      like it owns the place."


      "Day 3: We killed a couple of freakish moles,
      Finch calls em'' Gleam Moles but I''m not sure on the name. They''re becoming
      more of a problem, they come from below and surround us in an instant. It''s
      not that we can''t handle em'' but their aggression is difficult to deal with
      We''ve tried to avoid em'' but Finch got bit eariler so we''ll need to take
      things slow."


      "Day 4: We found a deer today, half of it was crushed
      beneath a boulder, a fucking boulder ! The exposed half was missing, we assume
      the beast took it as it''s prize... we decided to follow the blood trail and
      came across a huge burrow entrance, still intact ! If he''s lurking down there
      in the mornin'' we''ll try our luck, and see if we can lure it out."


      "Day
      5: This is Finch, Jo''s gone. We should never ave'' come here,we had no idea
      how intelligent this thing is. Once it knew we were inside placing bait, it
      collapsed the tunnel, Jo got a burial and I almost lost an arm when it tried
      to cut me off. Don''t go looking for the thing, gold''s no good if you''re
      buried below the earth."
