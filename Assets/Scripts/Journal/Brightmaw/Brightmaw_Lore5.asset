    text: "\u201CDay 1: We\u2019re on the monster's trail! Honestly, I'd almost say
      the thing\u2019s cocky,\r leaving carrion, burrows, and ripped-up foliage all
      over like it owns the\r place.\u201D\r\n\n\u201CDay 3: We killed a couple of
      these pale dog-looking things, they\u2019re\r\nbecoming a problem, they come
      out of the ground and from all over. It\u2019s not\r\nthat we can\u2019t handle
      them, but their aggression is difficult to deal with.\r\nWe\u2019ve been mostly
      avoiding them but Finch got bit earlier, so we need to\r\ntake this slower.\u201D\r\n\n\u201CDay
      4: We found a deer today, half of it was buried under a boulder, a\r\nfucking
      boulder! The exposed half was missing, I assume that's the\r\nmonster's prize\u2026
      We followed the blood trail and found one of its tunnels,\r\nthis one still
      intact. If it\u2019s still there in the morning we\u2019ll try our luck, and
      see\r\nif we can lure it out.\u201D\r\n\n\u201CDay 5: This is Finch writing,
      Jo\u2019s gone. We should never have come out here,\r we had no idea how intelligent
      the thing is. Once it knew we were inside\r placing bait, it collapsed the
      tunnel, Mal got a free burial and I almost lost\r an arm when it tried to cut
      me off. Don\u2019t go looking for this thing, gold\u2019s no\r good if you\u2019re
      too cold to spend it.\u201D \n\n- Diary, Josephine Ryland & Finch\r Bradbury.\r"
