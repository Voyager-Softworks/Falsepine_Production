  m_title: Story by Larry Millage
  entryContent:
    text: "\"I tell ya, critter's big as a bear an' twice as mean! There I was, my
      old pals Smith and Wessen close at hand. When I hear some bugger hollerin'
      after settin' off a clamper. It happens from time to time so me and my four-legged
      pal Benny head over to let the fool out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, we get there and
      as expected some poor sod has his boot in the steel jaw. I start walkin' over,
      but just as I get close this light starts pushing through the dirt below him.
      The biggest meanest bastard I ever laid eyes on took the lad's leg and clamped
      down like the jaws of hell. Couldn't do nothin' for him, Benny's smart, he
      knows when to fight and when to flee, we both legged it. The moral is simple
      lad, hunt anywhere else, Brightmaw is king around those woods.\r\n\r\n- Transcribed
      Story, Larry Millage\r\n\r"
