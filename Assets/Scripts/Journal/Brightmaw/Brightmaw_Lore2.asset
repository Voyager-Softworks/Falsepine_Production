    text: " \u201CI tell ya, critter\u2019s big as a bear an\u2019 twice as mean!
      There I was, my\r\nold pals Smith and Wessen close at hand. When I hear some
      bugger\r\nhollerin\u2019 after settin off a clamper. It happens from time to
      time so me and\r\nmah dog Benny, we head over to let the fool out.\u201D\r\n\n\u201CSo
      we get there, and as expected some fella has his boot in the ol steel jaw.\r
      So I start walkin over, but then this light starts pushing through the dirt\r\nunder
      him. Biggest meanest bastard I've ever seen takes the lad\u2019s legs like\r\nthe
      jaws of hell. Couldn\u2019t do nothin' for him, and Benny\u2019s a smart dog,
      he\r\nknew that\u2019s a bad fight, so we both legged it. Moral of the story\u2019s
      simple lad,\r\nhunt somewhere else, Brightmaw runs the show out there.\u201D
      \n\n-Transcribed\r Story, Larry Millage.\r"
