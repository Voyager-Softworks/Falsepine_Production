    text: "\u201CWhat goes Bump in the Night: A collection of pagan sightings.\u201D\r\n\nNotes:\r\nThese
      new creatures are everywhere! At first I thought they were digging about aimlessly.
      Hunting for meals. But these new creatures have direction, drive even. I was
      climbing a tree to spend the night thinking that would help. When I awoke to
      several specimens starring up at me. Dare I say it was almost endearing, until
      I heard a howl from somewhere in the forest, the sound alone nearly made me
      fall off my branch. But what it did to the creatures implies hierarchy! They
      went into a frenzy, spitting corrosive substances at me! If it wasn\u2019t
      for a passing fellow with a long iron, i\u2019d have been done for. He warned
      me to pack up and leave, and after that encounter i\u2019ll be far from argumentative.
      \n\n- Diary of book author Dain Robston\r"
