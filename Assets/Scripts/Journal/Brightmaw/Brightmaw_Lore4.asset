  m_title: What Goes Bump in the Night by Dain Robston
  entryContent:
    text: "Author Notes:\n\"These new creatures are everywhere ! At first I thought
      they were digging about aimlessly. Hunting for food. But these beasts have
      a sense of purpose. I was climbing a tree to spend the night hoping to catch
      sight of the creatures. When I awoke to see several of the creatures starring
      up at me. Dare I saw it was almost endearing, until I heard a haunting howl
      ripple from deep within the forest, the sound alone sent shivers down my spine,
      I almost fell out of my spot ! But the effect it had on the creatures lends
      to a hierarchy ! The creatures went into a frenzy, spitting a sticky, corrosive
      substance at me ! If it wasn't for a passing stranger with a big iron on his
      hip, I'd be done for. He warned me to pack my stuff and leave, and after the
      encoutner I just had I was in no mood to disagree.\n\n- Diary of Dain Robston\n "
