    text: 'Seems some poachers tried to lure the Brightmaw out into the open for
      an ambush, most likely trying to capture or kill the beast for its thick, luminous
      hide. What they weren''t expecting was the creature to appear from below, it
      was to late for them but I just learnt some valuable info.
