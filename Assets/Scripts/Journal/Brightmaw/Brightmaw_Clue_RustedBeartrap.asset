  entryContent:
    text: 'Looking at this old beartrap, I can''t help but chuckle. Some poor poacher
      figured they could stop a burrowing creature with this. Based on common sense
      and the rusted trap certain tools won''t be of much use during this hunt. I
      wonder if a Fire Bottle could be used to create traps for surfacing moles ?
