    text: 'Well, that''s a horrific ending for someone, crushed in half by a huge
      boulder.  Only a beast of great strength and size could do this, it must be
      the Brightmaw I''ve been hunting. I better be aware of ranged strikes, I''d
      hate to be on the receiving end of one of these attacks.
