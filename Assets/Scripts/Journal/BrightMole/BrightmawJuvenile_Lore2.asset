    text: '"To the surpise of my colleagues, Bright Moles possess a rudimentary form
      of polymorphism during their infancy. This trait appears to diverge and be
      lost as the creature approaches adulthood. This kind of trait is common in
      insects, not mammels, and is often permanent. Juvenile Bright Moles appear
      to split in their physiology to better fit collective hunting needs. Some grow
      larger fangs and more powerful forelimbs, whereas others grow throat sacs and
      can propel stomach acid at their prey. However, once they grow into adulthood
      their secondary features are lost in exchange for rapid muscle growth. The
      limits of this growth have yet to be recorded due to most specimens being to
      large to contain after a certain size."
