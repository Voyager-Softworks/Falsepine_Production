    text: "To the surprise of many of my fellow researchers, Brightmoles possess
      a rudimentary form of polymorphism during their infancy. This trait appears
      to diverge and be lost as the animal approaches adulthood. This kind of trait
      is common in insects, not mammals, and is often permanent. \n\nJuvenile Brightmoles
      appear to diverge in their physiology to better fit the collective hunting
      needs. Some grow larger fangs and more powerful digging forelimbs, while others
      grow throat glands that propel caustic fluids at their prey. However, as they
      grow into adulthood, their secondary features are lost in exchange for rapid
      muscle and bone growth. The heights of this growth have not been recorded due
      to most specimens being too difficult to contain after a certain size.\n \n-
