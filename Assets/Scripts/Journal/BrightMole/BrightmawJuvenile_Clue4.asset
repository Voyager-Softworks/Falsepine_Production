  entryContent:
    text: 'A strange genetic mutation was found among "Spitters" this Bright Mole,
      which I dubbed "Lobbers" due to their unique attack method. Increased metabolism
      has given "Lobbers" an extra punch, whereas "Spitters" fire a single glob "Lobbers"
      can regurgitate 3 acidic globs. Although similar in size and appearance "Lobbers"
      can be spotted by their brilliant blue back.
