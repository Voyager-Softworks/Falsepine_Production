  entryContent:
    text: 'A strange genetic mutation was found among "Spitters" these Bright Moles,
      are dubbed "Lobbers" due to their unique attack method. Increased metabolism
      have given "Lobbers" an extra punch, whereas "Spitters" fire a single glob
      "Lobbers" can regurgitate 3 acidic projectiles. Although similar in size and
      appearance "Lobbers" can be spotted by their brilliant blue back. If I can
      manage to get close enough a swift swing of a melee weapon will make quick
      work of them.
