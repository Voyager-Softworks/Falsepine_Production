    text: "Over the past few months, I have slowly but surely become something of
      a local expert in regard to the relatively new invasive species infesting the
      Rusty Wildwoods. The townsfolk eventually decided to name the creatures \u201CBrightmoles\u201D
      which stole my thunder somewhat. Regardless, this species is fascinating. \n\nAfter
      watching the animals in the wild, capturing a live specimen, and performing
      a necropsy on several others, I have learned that this species possesses unorthodox
      physiology and unique behavioural patterns for a mammal, which they are. This
      species has proven a challenging case to study, however, the Sheriff places
      his trust in me that I shall find a solution to this problem by better understanding
      it.\n\n- Fauna Research Report, Susana Karten"
