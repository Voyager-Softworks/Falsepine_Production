    text: '"Over the past few months, I have slowly but surely become something of
      a local expert in regard to this new invasive species infesting the Rusty Wildwoods.
      Townsfolk dubbed the creatures "Bright Moles" which stole my thunder somewhat.
      Regardless this species is fascinating. After observing the creatures in the
      wild, capturing a live specimen and performing various tests and a necropsy,
      I have learnt that this species possesses unorthodox physiology and unique
      behavioural pattern for a mammal, which they are. This species has proven a
      challenging case to study, however, the Sheriff places his trust in me that
      I will complete my research."
