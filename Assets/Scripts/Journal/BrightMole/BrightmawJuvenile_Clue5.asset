  m_title: Bright Mole Ravager
  entryContent:
    text: 'Now this sub-species is interesting, studies have concluded that when
      an Alpha Bright Mole dies a power vacuum is created where Bright Moles fight
      to become the next Alpha and feast on the previous Alpha''s corpse. "Ravagers"
      as I aptly named them, are the elite of Bright Mole hierarchy often older and
      more battle-hardened. Members of this sub-species frequently become the next
      Alpha. Limited field encounters have shown that "Ravagers" packs a much harder
      punch and have a tougher hide. Identifiable by their large size and dark red
      hide, "Ravagers" get up close and personal when attacking, requiring well-timed
      dodges and a powerful close-range weapon to kill. Their penchant to burrow
      close and attack unfortunatly means I will have to get up close and personal
      with a melee weapon if I want to kill one.
