  m_title: Bright Mole Biters
  entryContent:
    text: '"Biters" are your run-of-the-mill Bright Mole sub-species, I have observed
      nothing unique in their behaviour, not to disregard "Biters", they are still
      dangerous creatures when attacking in swarms. Easily identified by the soft
      pink hide, "Biters" will burrow underground before emerging to attack their
      prey with their razor-sharp teeth. Through trial and error, I''ve learnt that
      the only way to kill a "Biter" is to trick it to attack leaving it vulnerable
      to a melee swing.
