  m_title: Bright Mole Physiology
  entryContent:
    text: 'After repeat encounters with the species dubbed "Bright Moles" I can confirm
      two things. Field examinations reveal a thick hide and stomach tract designed
      for digesting a multitude of foods. Confirming the hypothesis that this is
      a aggressive invasive species moving around feeding on the local fauna. After
      performing field autopsies and examing their behavior I can also confirm that
      Bright Moles are indeed non-occult in nature.
