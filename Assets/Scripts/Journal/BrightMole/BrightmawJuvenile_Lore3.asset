    text: "The Brightmoles continue to surprise and concern us. It appears their
      social behaviour differs from many pack-orientated mammals. Brightmoles have
      a pseudo-eusocial structure. Where the juveniles infest the local area expanding
      their hunting grounds, and finding food for the larger adults. This eusocial
      behaviour appears reluctant but is enforced by the dominant adults. \n\nShould
      the leading adult die, it is likely that the juveniles would undergo an opportunistic
      frenzy, feeding quickly and fighting each other, killing each other off until
      a new adult specimen emerges. Due to the adult's tendency to never let juveniles
      of the same sex reach maturity, we can be certain that killing the current
      adult specimen will force the brightmoles to reduce their own numbers.\n\n-
