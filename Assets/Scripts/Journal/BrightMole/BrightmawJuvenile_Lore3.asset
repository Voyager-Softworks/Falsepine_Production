    text: "\"Bright Moles continue to surprise and concern us. It appears their social
      behaviour differs from a majority of pack-orientated mammels. Bright Moles
      have a pseudo-eusocial structure. Where the juveniles infest the local area
      expanding their hunting grounds, and tunnel network finding food for higher
      status adults. This eusocial behaviour appears reluctant but is enforced by
      the dominant adult. Should the leading adult die it is likely that the juveniles
      would undergo an oppotunstic frenzy, feeding and fighting, killing each other
      off until a new adult specimen emerges. Due to the adult's tendency to never
      let juveniles of the same sex reach maturity, we can be certain the current
      Alpha will force the Bright Moles to reduce their own numbers.\"\n\n- Field
