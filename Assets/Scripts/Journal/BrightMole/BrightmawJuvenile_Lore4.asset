    text: "\"I have discovered a new specimen earlier, or perhaps it discovered me.
      I was examining the remains of a Juvenile that had underestimated a bear when
      a large specimen exploded out of the ground next to me. I lost the evening
      notes and equipment, though I should consider myself lucky the brute bit into
      my field notes first. It was difficult to analyse while fleeing, however, the
      creature was far larger than the typical specimen. It may have been on the
      edge of what size the Alpha would tolerate. The creature appeared adolescent,
      with increased muscle mass and more powerful forelimbs. While I wasn't able
      to glean much else, I am cautiously enthusiastic to witness another. From a
      respectable distance of course.\"\n\n- Field Report, Susana Karten \n"
