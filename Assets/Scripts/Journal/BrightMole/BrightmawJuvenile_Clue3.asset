  m_title: Bright Mole Spitters
  entryContent:
    text: 'I dubbed this variant of Bright Mole "Spitters" named after their observed
      behaviour of attacking their prey with an acidic glob formed in the creature''s
      gut. The smallest of the Bright Mole variants can be identified by their green
      hide and blue tongue. These creatures are skittish and won''t approach the
      human''s meaning a long-range weapon is needed to put em'' down.
