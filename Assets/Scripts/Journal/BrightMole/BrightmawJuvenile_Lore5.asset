    text: "\"The extent to which the Bright Moles polymorphism alters the body can
      really only be compared to that which we see in insects. Just an hour ago I
      spotted from my tree platform a strange new variant sporting a brilliant blue
      across its back and torso, without getting my hands on the specimen it will
      be difficult to confirm the cause for this morphology, however, I did observe
      the creature get into a dispute with another of it's kind. After a measure
      of threat displays, they burrowed below the surface, reemerging a minute later
      with more traditional specimens fleeing. The blue-tinted specimen sent a warning
      volley of caustic fluid at its aggressor. it appears this adaptation accelerates
      the build-up of acidic fluid they weaponize. Further research is required on
      this fascinating sub-species.\"\n\n- Field Report, Susana Karten \n"
