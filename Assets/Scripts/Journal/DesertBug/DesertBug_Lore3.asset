    text: "\u201CMear minutes ago I spied a truly impressive specimen! It erupted
      from the sand, shovelling an exit. The creature was huge and definitely had
      a specific morphology for the hive's purposes. The creature is darker, has
      more armour, and has larger raptorial appendages. It appeared to be working
      on the tunnel, solidifying the sand with a kind of secretion from its abdomen.
      For this reason, I believe the creature to be a kind of hive construction variant,
      and I shall be labelling it a Builder. I am uncertain of their aggression,
      however, it would be wise for any who are looking to traverse the badlands
      not to gain the of ire this variant. Its size, armour, and formidable tunnelling
      limbs should not be trifled with.\u201D\n\n- Fauna Research Report, Susana
