    text: "\u201CIt stands to reason that a species this ambitious in its methods
      would need a response to pressured aggression. In this case, the beast that
      stalks the skies here and the good people of Falsepine likely reinforce this
      need. Well, my assistant nearly made the fatal discovery earlier today, he
      was looking at a hive tunnel entrance while attempting to collect a sample
      of the Builder's secretion. Unfortunately, a previously unseen variant must
      have sensed the vibrations and it came skittering out! We took shelter in a
      small crevice, which also nearly ended badly. We were fortunate the creature's
      acidic spray has a limited reach. I am suitable for naming this variant the
      Hive Guard. It appears faster, larger, and more armoured than a typical male,
      with a high level of aggression. It eventually returned to the tunnel to safeguard
      it, leaving us an out. Be very careful poking around the hive, if you hear
      a distinct humming, retreat immediately.\u201D\n\n- Fauna Research Report,
