  entryContent:
    text: 'I''m not a man that often flinches but these "Plague Beetles" is something
      horrid. I''d rather take down a rampaging Bone Stag than face a hive of these
      horrors. In a strange twist of irony, the poison these creatures create is
      used in the distilling of Professor Karten''s Poison Ammo, mixed with the acidic
      spit of a Bright Mole we are able to melt the carapace of the "Plague Beetle"
      and deliver a deadly dose of poison right back at the creature that produced
      it.
