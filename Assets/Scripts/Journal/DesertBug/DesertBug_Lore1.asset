    text: "\"Many of Falsepine residents have told me about the dangers of what they
      refer to as \"Plague Beetles\" while their warnings do not fall on deaf ears,
      I find the hives to be a much simpler beast to understand, at least from a
      behavioural perspective, their morphology is still somewhat unusual. Plague
      Beetles are a curious species of arthropod that have somehow bypassed the hypoxia
      that limits insect growth. Additionally, this species appears to contain a
      hive structure, with drones, warriors, and grubs, yet no queen. This makes
      eusocial behaviour difficult to apply.\" \r\n\r\n- Fauna Research Report, Susana
      Karten\n"
