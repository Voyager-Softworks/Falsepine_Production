    text: '"While the Hives threat is not in question, their behaviour is basic enough
      for one to learn the best methods for avoidance. It appears that unlike other
      similar insects such as ants, the Plague Beetle females are infact the wingless
      drones, while the males are the flying warriors. At first, this was odd to
      me, however, it brings to light the purpose of having a queenless structure.
      Males and females breed periodically without hierarchy, additionally, the females
      carry their young with them after birth. The male flying variants appear to
      use their mobility and acidic spray to hunt, while the females close in and
      feed, nurturing themselves and the grubs as the prey is softened by the male''s
      acidic enzymes. This does raise the question of why the species is not nomadic.
      Or perhaps they are only partially, much like how we are. Curious, this requires
      further observations"
