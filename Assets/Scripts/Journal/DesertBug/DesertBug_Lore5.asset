    text: "\"I have been gifted with incredible luck ! My safety of course is better
      attributed to my expertise and a mild serving of luck. Though today I have
      nothing to thank but luck. My assistant today has retrieved living larvae !
      At first, I thought he was joking until I saw the large crate shuddering. He
      informs me that the drone parent had been mangled by some kind of predator
      he did not witness, yet the young had survived and were seeking shelter from
      the sun. Well, after heavily precautious and badly damaged tent, we managed
      to study it. Capture and release of course, but from what I can gather, the
      larvae are fierce and disturbingly intelligent for their age. They grow quite
      large, ours was about 23 Inches and appears to be extremely mobile. The specimen
      has a curious red offset between a soft the crevices of its soft white carapace.
      The presence of a carapace this early in the creature's life cycle is abnormal,
      I would be curious to see what an even earlier stage would look like.\u201D\n\n-
