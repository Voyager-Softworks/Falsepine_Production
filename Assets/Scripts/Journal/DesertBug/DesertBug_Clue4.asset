    text: 'Just when I thought they couldn''t get any worse I discovered they can
      fly ! These flying types seem to perform the role of a soldier. Often seen
      protecting "Drones" and "Builders". The "Plague Beetle Warrior" utilizes a
      poison spray, covering the area in noxious gas. A more deadly variant has also
      been spotted, and can be identified by their larger carapace and orange colouration.
      They seem similar in most regards however the larger variant dubbed "Hive Guards"
      are quicker and deadlier in every way. Regardless of type, a high-power rifle
      or shotgun will make quick work of them.
