    text: "\u201CThe third knows nothing, a simple being of the barest sentience.
      Fitting it be that its awakening required a sacrifice the viper has already
      made. Blood fed its body yet spirit its mind. Before long it who knows nothing
      shall become they who know many things. They are an amalgamator of spirit.
      An endless symphony of irrelevant thought, coherent only in goal. To grow,
      to drink, to wail.\u201D \n\n- Unknown"
