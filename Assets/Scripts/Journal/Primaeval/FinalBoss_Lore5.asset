    text: "\u201CShe who is fourth shall be a terrible herald. Her power, a display
      of awe. Be it her voice that strikes fear into the viper, be it her command
      of the skies fury that sunders the viper. For her kind is that of a messenger,
      a being who foretells oblivion through demonstration. Should her message fall
      deaf upon the viper, then her Omen shall prelude the end, an end we shall birth.\u201D
