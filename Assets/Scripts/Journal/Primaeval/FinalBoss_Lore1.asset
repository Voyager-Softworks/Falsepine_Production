  entryContent:
    text: '"Before it all, they were akin to beasts, excelling in little. We knew
      not their ambition, and the old ways knew not the viper that entered the cradle.
      Our ignorance cost the old ways, an affliction without remedy. Ask not the
      viper to spare its fangs, for that is all it understands, eclipsed from higher
      thought. Instead, the viper shall die, wither and pass away, so the cradle
      will be made safe once more."
