    text: "\u201COne before another and another, the land awakens, We shall \r\nmake
      it so, our knowledge, our understanding shall invoke that which rested. A rest
      offered to allow the cradle to grow, for their hooves, claws and fury would
      surely trample a newly sprouted sapling. It is regrettable that their rest
      would be broken. However rot threatens the sapling, and their ire shall now
      be the cradle's saviour. The first of them shall infest the soil, and his siblings
      fearing dominance, shall ravage the land for his appetite. May his infesting
      light feed well.\u201D \n\n- Unknown\r\n"
