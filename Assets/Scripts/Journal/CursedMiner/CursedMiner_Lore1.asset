    text: "When considering those who were lost to the Grizzly Peaks mining incident,
      I had at first thought their confirmed sightings to be a kind of paganistic
      necromancy. This was a false assumption, the survivors appear to be suffering
      an affliction. Causing jagged protrusions to sprout from their body, their
      skin appears to be rapidly losing melanin, and beyond the physical mutations,
      their behaviour is erratic. \n\nBoth the godless and men of faith now worship
      some kind of \u201CCrescent\u201D being, they have a madness to them that doesn't
      appear to dampen their intellect to the point where they will not use weapons.
      It is imperative we find the cause of this supernatural illness before it infects
      the surrounding regions. \n\n- Field Report, Susana Karten"
