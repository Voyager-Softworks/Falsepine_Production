    text: "\"The largest of the \"Afflicted\" I've categorized as Brutes for the
      sake of clarity. These individuals appear to have suffered mutations that enhance
      their bone density and muscle mass. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, their skin lesions
      have a much deeper red it is difficult to know for certain, though it is my
      assumption that this is a later stage of infection. Despite their size, Brute's
      strength still remains disproportionately high. I have personally witnessed
      an event in which a Brute charged through a tree when stimulated by the vocalizations
      made during worship. With the other-worldly nature of their condition, I cannot
      confirm or deny if the Brute is the final stage of their infection.\"    \n\n-
