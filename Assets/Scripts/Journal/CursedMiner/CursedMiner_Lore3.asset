    text: "The largest of the afflicted I\u2019ve categorized as Brutes for the sake
      of clarity. These individuals appear to have suffered mutations that enhance
      their bone density and muscle mass. \n\nAdditionally, they sport a greater
      number of protrusions than other specimens. it is difficult to know for certain,
      though it is my assumption that this is a later stage of infection. Despite
      their size, Brute\u2019s strength still remains disproportionately high. I
      have personally witnessed an event in which a Brute charged through a tree
      when stimulated by the vocalizations made during worship. With the other-worldly
      nature of their condition, I cannot confirm or deny if the Brute is the final
      stage of their infection.  \n\n- Field Report, Susana Karten"
