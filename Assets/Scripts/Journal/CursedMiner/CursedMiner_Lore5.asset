    text: "\"During one of my field enterprises, I came across a notebook left behind
      in a partially collapsed mine shaft the Sheriff's men had secured. Its contents
      are both troubling and enlightening, they shall be transcribed below.\r\"\n\r\n-
      Day 3: At first, I thought the lads were just getting prickly after 2 days
      of us trying to dig our way out. But now I know it wasn\u2019t frustration
      alone. They\u2019re getting skittish, like dogs, and I can\u2019t blame em,
      I hear it too.\r\n\r\n- Day 5: Rations are low, but we\u2019re almost out,
      that sound, in all our heads, it\u2019ll stop. It\u2019ll stop as soon as we\u2019re
      out, it\u2019ll stop. It\u2019ll stop.\r\n\r\n- Day ? Crunch, snap, rip, crunch,
      snap, rip. It\u2019s here, yes it is, I see what they see. We are all harvests,
      seeds of the field. Crunch, snap, rip, oh it\u2019s beautiful, what joy to
      be its slave. Crunch, snap, rip.\r\n\r\nTHE JOY. SNAP. THE FIELD GROWS. OUR
      TEMPLES SOW THE BOUNTY. RIP. OUR CROP TO EASE HIS BURDEN. GLORY TO THE FIELD.
      GLORY TO THE BUCK. CRUNCH. GLORY TO THE STAG. \n\n- Field Transcript, Susana
      Karten\r\n"
