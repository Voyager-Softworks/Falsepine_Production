  entryContent:
    text: 'Not much can shake me but these Afflicted "Zealots" are a fearsome foe.
      It seems this is a late stage in the "Afflicted''s" disease as their body has
      undergone a strange growth spurt and are considerably larger than a person,
      their sores are a much richer red, more akin to the Bone Stag. Although rare
      "Zealots" are a deadly enemy, preferring to leap great lengths through the
      air and performing a letal ground slam. A skilled hunter, such as myself can
      dodge this attack and retaliate with a swing from a melee weapon or a blast
      from a shotgun.
