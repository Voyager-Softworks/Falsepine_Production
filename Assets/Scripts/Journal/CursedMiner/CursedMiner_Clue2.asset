  entryContent:
    text: 'These are the most common type of "Afflicted", classed as "Miners" this
      is what remains of the Falsepine Mining Co. It seems that this disease was
      first found among these poor souls. Identifiable by the orange sores covering
      their body, these creatures are almost completely feral and will go after anything
      that enters their territory, chasing them down and swinging at them with pickaxes.
      A few well-placed beartraps can help thin a swarm when they charge.
