  m_title: Afflicted Bomber
  entryContent:
    text: The second type "Afflicted" has been nicknamed "Bomber" due to its odd
      fascination to charge a player with lit dynamite. If anything it shows the
      dedication these "Afflicted" have to their master, doing anything in their
      power to halt intruders. "Bombers" can be spotted by their orange sores and
      their hunched-over frame. When the "Bomber" notices an intruder they will begin
      getting close to said intruder and once close enough will prime the dynamite
      it holds. A well-timed dodge can save you but the best solution is to kill
      them with a rifle before they get close. And some good news for once if they
      should explode they will damage anything close enough to them, this includes
      their "Afflicted" brethren. Some hunters have told stories of a "Bomber" faster
      and more deadly, I've been told should you encoutner an inconspicuous red mount
      buried in the snow to run away as quickly as possible.
