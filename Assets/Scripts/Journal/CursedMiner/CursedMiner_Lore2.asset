  entryContent:
    text: "\u201CThe afflicted seem to be creating a new social hierarchy, built
      upon brutality and severity of their mutation. I have been unable to divine
      the purpose of the skulls they now wear, however, those with the least mutations
      and physical stature act as the bottom rung. \n\nThey are aggressive yet subordinate
      to the larger afflicted. The supernatural nature of the illness explains its
      complexity, though I hypothesize many die from their mutations, hence the abundance
      of lower-ranked less mutated members. Regardless, they are difficult to study,
      as even the lowest members of the hierarchy wield weapons, some going as far
      as to carry explosives.\"\n\n- Field Report, Susana Karten\n"
