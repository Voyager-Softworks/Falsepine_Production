    text: "During my carefully distanced research of the mind-altering affliction
      our lost workers suffer, I have noticed an abnormality that appears divergent
      from the typical course of infected behaviour. Individuals with this behavioural
      change have been labelled: Zealots. Many of the afflicted appear to only be
      self-serving outside of worship. With only the lowest rung having decisions
      made for them. \n\nZealots on the other hand display uncharacteristic altruism.
      These members are typically smaller than Brutes but are larger and faster than
      the common afflicted. Their mutations are more pronounced in that their body
      exudes an odd purple light, which is convenient for identifying one. Zealot
      altruism is dangerous in that an aggressor is set upon in full force, with
      little consideration for the zealot's wellbeing, in the defence of other afflicted.
      This kind of specimen is rare, though can be often sighted during worship.
      They are particularly protective of Brutes which seems moot but is in fact
      very dangerous.  \n\n- Field Report, Susana Karten"
