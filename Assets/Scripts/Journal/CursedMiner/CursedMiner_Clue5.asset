  entryContent:
    text: "Folk always wondered what happen to the woodsman that used to harvest
      the mighty pines found in the region well it seems they fell under the influence
      of the Stag. These \"Afflicted\" are much larger than a human and have the
      temper and strength to match. Dubbed \"Brutes\" these heavy hitters move much
      slower than their \"Afflicted\" brothers, but should you get caught under their
      axe it's something you won't soon forget. If you see a towering red mase of
      muscle and rage barreling towards you remember to keep your distance and keep
      blockades between you and it.\r"
