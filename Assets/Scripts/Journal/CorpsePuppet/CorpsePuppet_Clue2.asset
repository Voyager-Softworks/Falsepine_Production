  entryContent:
    text: 'The most commonly sighted Corpse Puppet, I named them "Strikers" for their
      simple but effective method of attacking, they prefer to get in close and flail
      their body hitting anything in their path. It seems in the grander root system
      these "Strikers" are at the bottom of the rung and can be identified by their
      rather small and frail "bodies" and sickly green sap. A good melee weapon will
      make quick work of their roots. As long as I''m careful enough to dodge their
      attacks.
