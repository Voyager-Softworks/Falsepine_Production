    text: "\u201CI may never sleep again, I knew that unexplainable pagan things
      resided from the old world, but I never had imagined their tangibility. We
      broke free and are making our way back now. I grow frustrated, feeling as if
      I am the only person here who is comprehending the horrors we suffered, the
      locals appear to have accepted it. Their bravery, jaded grit, or whatever they
      use to push through is well appreciated regardless. I digress, I must record
      what we encountered. Where the roots converge there appears to be a form a
      sort of amalgamation where smaller roots fuse, typical as that is, some are
      sentient. At least I believe it to be sentience. This configuration I have
      referred to as Amalgams, they are enormous fusions of bark, mud, water, human
      remains, and something else. We thought keeping away from the amalgam would
      keep us safe, but that was before I realised what we falling back from. Spewed
      from its mass we were assailed by some kind of supernatural force, ghosts?
      Phantoms? The Souls of the dead? I know not, but the lone local who was caught
      in it when glassy-eyed. I\u2019m glad to be done with this place, it is an
      unholy place I will have no part in.\u201D\r\n\r\n- Flora Report, Susana Karten\n"
