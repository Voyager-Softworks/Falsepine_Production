    text: '"Even as I write this I am unsure of myself in the bayou. The extensive
      research into dangerous fauna and hands-on approach has equipped me suitably,
      however, this is something wrong here. Something that gives me pause, if my
      research will even benefit the scientific community or even the locals. The
      fauna here is entirely out of balance. Larger creatures such as alligators,
      big cats and deer appear to be absent, and there has been an explosion of flora,
      specifically a strange root structure. The roots possess abnormalities in their
      structure and bark, slowly expanding and shrinking as if breathing, and the
      bark has a strange give to it. I am unsure what this all means, but the locals
      are counting on us."
