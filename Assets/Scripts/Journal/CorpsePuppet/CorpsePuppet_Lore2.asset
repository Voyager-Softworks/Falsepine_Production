    text: 'I was right, well as right as someone who knows nothing about the situation
      can be. I am the wrong person for the job. This isn''t an anomaly within the
      ecosystem, this is a supernatural phenomenon. Be that as it may, it is my job
      to document what I can, and so I shall. I''m glad to have capable hands with
      me this time, I wouldn''t dare remain here on my own. The root structure appears
      to be expanding through an occult influence, I can only determine this due
      to its impossibility. Additionally, I have witnessed the roots moving! Their
      locomotion appears basic, though far more complex than any other plant that
      moves through the manipulation of water. At first, this was thought to be strange
      but benign, but I was wrong. When one of the locals got in the water to help
      cut a sample, it sprung around him. The others tried to free him but we lost
      him below the water. We''re moving outside its range of influence for the time
      being. His death is lamentable, and a testament to the wrongs of the occult
      world."
