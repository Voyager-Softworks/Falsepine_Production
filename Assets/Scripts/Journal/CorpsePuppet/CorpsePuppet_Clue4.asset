    text: Now, this is where it gets interesting, I was clearing out a growth of
      Strikers when a meaner than usual-looking Screamer started making his way towards
      me. I loaded my trusty rifle with Silver Tipped Round when all of a sudden
      this son of a bitch let out an ear-pitching scream and before I knew it was
      surrounded by "Strikers" I would've made it out if not for a supply of Fire
      Bombs. Lesson learnt DO NOT get close to these "Conjurers" my brief sighting
      of it caught a few distinct details, the first was its large size and more
      prominent root growth. The second was its much deeper green sap, handing for
      identifying em' in the foggy bayou. Similar to the "Screamer" a well place
      fire bottle will burn through their roots.
