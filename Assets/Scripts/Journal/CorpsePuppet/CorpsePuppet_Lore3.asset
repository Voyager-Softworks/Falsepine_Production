    text: "\u201CWe are in crisis. Two nights ago while we slept, the roots entangled
      our paths, and we dare not test the waters. The entangling of our paths appears
      to possess intent, cutting off escape routes, science has no place here, we
      are dealing with an entity. Regardless I will continue to write what I find
      while the locals cut us a path. We had another attack, it was far less costly,
      however, more terrifying. A root emerges from the ground, rearing like a snake!
      Worst of all it had drawn mud, water and human remains along with it. We realised
      the extent of the horror when it started to manipulate the remains, mocking
      humanoid motion. A local opened fire on it, and resilient as it was the root
      retreated after losing substantial mass. My saviours are melting down their
      forward payments to try weaponising, they\u2019re confident silver will harm
      the being. I know nothing of such remedies, but this is no longer the place
      for an academic opinion.\u201D\n\n- Flora Report, Susana Karten\n"
