  entryContent:
    text: 'A slightly rarer variant, these Corpse Puppet "Screamers" are terrifying
      if encountered up close. Whether signs of intelligence or just plain ol'' bad
      luck, I have encountered "Screamers" hiding amongst the weaker "Strikers",
      showing ambush behaviour. Through a lot of error, I have noticed some slight
      variations to aid in spotting a "Screamer". Keep a keen eye out for larger
      root constructs formed with multiple bones and skulls. If you spot a "Striker"
      remember to keep your distance and prioritise cutting em'' down before they
      reach you. Their unique abilities lend to longer range weapons such as rifles
      and fire bombs to take em'' out well before they get close enough scream.
