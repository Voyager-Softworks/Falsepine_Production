  entryContent:
    text: Heed my warning, do not take on an "Abomination" without preparation. These
      hulking monstrosities seem to be the enforcers of the Bayou remaining dormant
      until it senses a threat nearby. When its alerted prepare for a long-range
      attack, keeping a medium distance is key, get to close and you'll find yourself
      whomped by one of its tendrils. I've seen something out there it looks like
      an Abomination but far more deadly if you lay your eyes on the emerald green
      roots be prepared for a tough fight.
