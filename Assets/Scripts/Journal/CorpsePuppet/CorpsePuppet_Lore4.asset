    text: "\r\u201CThe attacks are getting worse, more frequent. The local's silver
      weapons are providing a modicum of protection, so that is reassuring. This
      morning we discovered a new variation of our assailant, a horrid fusion of
      many remains, each root appears to claim specific remains, and almost seems
      to possess unique personalities between each. Some attack and others watch.
      Some stab, some scream. This one in particular screamed and I felt my mind
      ignite. It appears to emit a kind of force when wailing, one local lost his
      hearing and another is now blind. I pray I lose none of my own functions. We
      are almost out though, and once the Sheriff is armed with my sightings he will
      have all he needs to combat this entity, my colleagues however will likely
      never believe my findings.\u201D\r\n\n- Flora Report, Susana Karten"
